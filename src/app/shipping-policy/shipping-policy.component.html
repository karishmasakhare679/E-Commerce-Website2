                            <h3>What are the delivery charges?</h3>
                            <p>
                                <b>Delivery charge varies with each Seller.</b>
                                Sellers incur relatively higher shipping costs on low value items. In such cases,
                                charging a nominal delivery charge helps them offset logistics costs. Please check your
                                order summary to understand the delivery charges for individual products. <br>
                                For Productsy listed as Wingotrends Plus, a Rs 40 charge for delivery per item may be
                                applied if the order value is less than Rs 500. While, orders of Rs 500 or above are
                                delivered free.<br>
                                Why does the delivery date not correspond to the delivery timeline of X-Y business days?
                                It is possible that the Seller or our courier partners have a holiday between the day
                                your placed your order and the date of delivery, which is based on the timelines shown
                                on the product page. In this case, we add a day to the estimated date. Some courier
                                partners and Sellers do not work on Sundays and this is factored in to the delivery
                                dates. <br>
                                <a>What is the estimated delivery time?</a><br>
                                Sellers generally procure and ship the items within the time specified on the product
                                page. Business days exclude public holidays and Sundays.

                            </p>
                            <h3>Estimated delivery time depends on the following factors:</h3>
                            <p>
                                • The Seller offering the product
                                • Product's availability with the Seller
                                • The destination to which you want the order shipped to and location of the Seller.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Are there any hidden costs (sales tax, octroi etc) on items sold by Sellers on
                                Wingotrends?</h4>
                            <p>
                                There are NO hidden charges when you make a purchase on Wingotrends.List prices are
                                final
                                and all-inclusive. The price you see on the product page is exactly what you would pay.
                                <br><br>
                                Delivery charges are not hidden charges and are charged (if at all) extra depending on
                                the Seller's shipping policy.<br><br>

                            </p>



                            <h4><a>Why does the estimated delivery time vary for each seller?</a></h4>
                            <p>
                                You have probably noticed varying estimated delivery times for sellers of the product
                                you are interested in. Delivery times are influenced by product availability, geographic
                                location of the Seller, your shipping destination and the courier partner's
                                time-to-deliver in your location. <br> <br>
                                Please enter your default pin code on the product page (you don't have to enter it every
                                single time) to know more accurate delivery times on the product page itself.
                                Seller does not/cannot ship to my area. Why? <br> <br>
                                Please enter your pincode on the product page (you don't have to enter it every single
                                time) to know whether the product can be delivered to your location. <br> <br>
                                If you haven't provided your pincode until the checkout stage, the pincode in your
                                shipping address will be used to check for serviceability.

                            </p>
                            <h4><b>Whether your location can be serviced or not depends on : </b></h4>
                            <p>
                                • Whether the Seller ships to your location <br>
                                • Legal restrictions, if any, in shipping particular products to your location <br>
                                • The availability of reliable courier partners in your location <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At times Sellers prefer not to ship to certain locations. This is entirely at their
                                discretion.

                            <p>
                                • Availability of COD depends on the ability of our courier partner servicing your
                                location to accept cash as payment at the time of delivery. <br><br>
                                • Our courier partners have limits on the cash amount payable on delivery depending on
                                the
                                destination and your order value might have exceeded this limit. Please enter your pin
                                code on the product page to check if COD is available in your location.

                                <b>'In Stock'</b><br>
                                • For items listed as "In Stock", Sellers will mention the delivery time based on your
                                location pincode (usually 2-3 business days, 4-5 business days or 4-6 business days in
                                areas where standard courier service is available). For other areas, orders will be sent
                                by Registered Post through the Indian Postal Service which may take 1-2 weeks depending
                                on the location.<br><br>

                                for the item. The delivery time will depend on the estimated procurement time and the
